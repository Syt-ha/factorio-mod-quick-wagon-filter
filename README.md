# Quick Wagon Filter

![Mod Interface](img/gui.png)

## Overview

Quick Wagon Filter is a Factorio mod designed to streamline the process of setting inventory filters for cargo wagons in trains. It provides a convenient window for selecting an item and applying it as a filter to either a single wagon or all wagons in a train.

## How to Use

1. Open the inventory of a cargo wagon in your train.
2. Use the mod's window to choose an item.
3. Click "Apply to this wagon" to set the chosen item as a filter for the current wagon.
4. Alternatively, click "Apply to all wagons" to apply the filter to all wagons in the train.
