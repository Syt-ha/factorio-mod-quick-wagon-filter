  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug where attempting to change the filter on a moving train would lead to a game crash.
      This issue was related to the usage of `get_output_inventory` during the movement of the train.
      The fix involved switching to a more reliable method, `get_inventory(defines.inventory.cargo_wagon)`.
      (Thanks https://github.com/VortiK for the report)
